        <p>We are very inspired with the idea of making something similar to the game Splatoon, a game where players must shoot blobs to paint the entire playing field. Therefore, we want to make a project similar to it where the user can move the camera in first-person view and shoot onto the terrain. Upon impact of the blobs, they will explode and change the color of the affected terrain. To do so, we will implement fluids that will naturally help us animate the impact and explosions of the projectiles. Our project will be set in a sandbox area where the user can freely move, look, and shoot around. Additionally, there will be obstacles like small walls where the user can also paint over. For this project only, we will not be implementing any blasters that the user will see on their screen. The liquid projectile will be shot out via direction of the camera. In addition, the user will have the option to toggle between day and night. During the day, the paint will have a goo-like texture to it but during the night, the paint will start to glow.</p>

          <strong>Motivation</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>We want to demonstrate fluid physics and are also very inspired by the game Splatoon. We believe that coding fluid physics is much more interesting in comparison to making physics for rigid objects due to the fact that we never worked with liquid objects before and want to learn how. The goal of this project is to demonstrate fluid physics in a subtle and interesting way. The idea of self-creating a colorful world also sounds interesting as there are no boundaries in what we can make.</p>

          <strong>Day & Night Rendering</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>This objective aims to vary the visuals of the simulator to make it more interesting, as well as to give ourselves an additional challenge in rendering fluid particles.  
		The simulator will render in two modes: Day and Night. 
		In the Day mode, the fluid will have goo-like properties and its original color with a faint glow effect. 
		In contrast, the Night mode will render the fluid with more intensity in its color. 
		These render modes are mainly characterized by a change in lighting with a button press. Pressing 'K' will render the scene in Day mode, while 'L' will render it in Night mode.

          <strong>Fluid Simulation</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>Fluid simulation is the main objective of our simulation. It's our goal to reproduce the properties and behaviours of a paint ball shot from a shooter. For this, we need to simulate a viscuous fluid using fluid particles' methods such as Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). To achieve this, particles need to be created and be manipulated as a liquid object. Then, with SPH formulas, we should be able to render liquid behaviours.</p>

          <strong>Projectile Motion Simulation</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>This objective aims to make our simulation closer to real paint ball shooters with the physics of a goo-like fluid for projectile motions. When a paint ball is shot, it's more appealing and correct for it to travel in a curved trajectory rather than shooting straight out of the shooter. As such, the paint shot should follow an arc trajectory or have a bullet drop effect. This will be achieved by the varied force, along with applied physics to the fluid particles.</p>

          <strong>Collision Detection</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>For our simulation to work, collision detection must be implemented. This objective is necessary as the paint ball will splatter onto the walls and the terrain. On collision, the paint should also apply its color onto the collided scene objects. Because we are using fluid particles, any particle that collides with a scene object would also behave the same way as a paint ball should.</p>

          <strong>Varied Shot Force</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>The force to shoot the paint ball should vary in order to simulate different projectile trajectories. This will depend on a force applied on the shooter's trigger, which will be calculated based on the mouse hold time. As such, holding the left mouse button for a long time should give more initial velocity to the paint ball than when it's held for a short amount of time.</p>

          <strong>Basic Lighting</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>In order to show how the fluid particles interact with the environment and the influence of the Day and Night rendering modes, it is crucial to have basic lighting. 
		Basic lighting is a must for rendering goo-like fluid as the latter needs to be seen in different colors, but it also needs to be visually appealing. 
		This objective helps in creating depth in the scene, which is a critical element for 3D animations.</p>

          <strong>Enable Movement</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>Allowing movement in the sandbox would give more freedom to the user. With this objective, one can shoot anywhere inside the viewport of the window while moving around. Achieving this objective adds more variety and freedom to where the user can go and shoot.</p>

          <strong>Vary Paint Color</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>To make things a bit more interesting, we have an objective to vary the paint colors that the user can shoot in the world. This way, the simulation becomes less dull. The different paint colors should also overlap one another depending on which was shot first. Once the paint lands on an object, it would an area of it as the color shot.</p>

          <strong>Skybox</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>Adding a skybox as an objective is to make the scene more aesthetically pleasant to look at rather than running the simulation in a uniform background color. Because we have Day & Night rendering modes, we need two skyboxes and functionality to toggle between them as lighting would. This would make use of skybox shaders and texture rendering in order to apply them to the window.</p>
